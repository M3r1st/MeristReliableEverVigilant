# [WOTC] Reliable Ever Vigilant Redux
Steam Workshop: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3546124299

## What is this?
Just like the previous incarnations, this mod stops Ever Vigilant from being invalidated by free neutral or uncontrollable actions.

*Unlike* the original mod, this version does not rely on a custom effect game state, which caused EV to not always work properly with other end-of-turn effects, and has better support for additional overwatch abilities.

## Compatibility
* If added mid-tactical, the changes won't take an effect until the next mission.
* Overwrites the changes done by the original Reliable Ever Vigilant. Mods that modify the original triggers will no longer have an effect.
* Can be used as a replacement for Reliable Ever Vigilant in most, if not all, cases.

## Credits
* Original mod by -bg-.
* Previous WOTC port by Veehementia.
